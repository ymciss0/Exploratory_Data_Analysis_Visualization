## 💡 Key Takeaways

Data visualization is essential for transforming raw numbers into actionable insights. Through this coursework, I learned that effective visualizations do more than make data "look pretty"—they reveal hidden patterns, test assumptions, identify outliers, and communicate complex relationships that would be nearly impossible to detect in tables alone. Whether exploring distributions, relationships between variables, geographical patterns, or high-dimensional data through techniques like PCA, the right visualization approach can be the difference between missing critical insights and making data-driven decisions with confidence.
